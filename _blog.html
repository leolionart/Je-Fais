                            <p>The wedding planning process can bring out the best  – and the worst in people. Sometimes you may feel like throwing in the towel, forgetting about the whole wedding thing and running away together. And that might just be the best idea ever! In fact, heaps of couples have scrapped their big, fancy wedding plans and said ‘hell yeah!’ to running away from it all. ( Want some inspiration? Check out the elopements section on IW. )</p>

<p>Here are 10 reasons why you might want to nix your wedding plans and opt for an elopement instead!</p>

1. You will save money. Lots of it.

                            <p>Running away together has become something couples choose for practical reasons; one of those being finances. Some people would rather spend money on honeymoon travel, a deposit on a house or a big purchase instead of a wedding. A fun, informal party to celebrate your wedding when you return is the perfect way to appease guests who weren’t invited.</p>

2. Planning your wedding is less time-consuming and less stressful.

<p>Don’t want to spend a year or more of your life planning a wedding? Don’t want to wait a year or more to get married? Then go ahead and get married – it’s as simple as that.  You will save many hours of hard work by having a quick elopement.</p>

3. You get to travel!

<p>Who doesn’t love an excuse to travel? An elopement gives you a license to follow your heart and travel somewhere you’ve always wanted to go.</p>

4.  You can get married just about anywhere.

<p>Since there is just the two of you (and maybe a handful of guests), you can get really creative with your wedding location. Want to get married on a mountaintop? Inside a forest? At your favorite cafe? On a remote beach? The choices are endless.</p>

5. No Wedding Party Troubles:

<p>One of the reasons I didn’t have a wedding party at my wedding was to avoid the extra stress of coordinating a wedding party; it was one thing I didn’t have to worry about and I could focus on other things, as well as us as a couple. You may look for ways to strike things off the list or forgo the wedding task list completely and elope.</p>

6. You won’t have an audience.

<p>Shy brides will empathize with the anxiety that comes with being the center of attention in a room full of people. Having to socialize, mingle and say your vows in front of everyone you know is a scary thought for some people who prefer a quieter setting. If this sounds like you, an elopement might be the perfect fit.</p>

7. You won’t have to pay as much for gorgeous photos.

<p>Trust me, photographers LOVE elopements. They know that there is something so incredibly magical about them. They also don’t have to put as much time in to cover your event – which means less expense for you!</p>

8. It’s quick!

<p>There are many reasons why couples choose to elope ranging from pregnancies to family issues to military duties. Sometimes those reasons necessitate a short planning duration. It is difficult to plan a 100-guest wedding in two weeks – but an elopement is entirely doable!</p>

9. You can be adventurous.

<p>Without having to worry about a guest list, you can be as adventurous as you want to be. Maybe you’ve always wanted to explore the rugged terrain of Iceland or the tropical rainforests of Costa Rica, but you’ve always found an excuse not to go. An elopement can be the push you need to take a chance on something just outside the edge of your comfort zone.</p>

10. You can focus on the love, rather than the guest list.

<p>Instead of worrying about your Aunt Myrtle getting sloshed, or your cousin Vinnie telling lurid jokes to your mother-in-law during the reception, you can focus solely on the love between you and your partner. And we think that’s the best reason of all.t</p></div><!--/text-->

                            <p>Last Saturday we headed back down to the land of Carlsbad to capture the union of Noah and Rachael. From the beginning we knew this was going to be an epic wedding and were so stoked to be filming at the famous celebrity estate, the Leo Carrillo Ranch. Everything about this wedding was amazing and was so much fun to capture. Both Noah and Rachael had so much unique personality and a subtle joy through the day. When I first met Noah I knew we would be friends as we both have mustaches. We created this movie to show at the end of the night and I was very blessed to see how it moved the audience.</p>

                            <p>We also had a great time shooting with our new friend Tec Petaja. I have admired his work for some time and it was really great to meet the Nashville master behind it all. I hope we shoot together more.</p>



                            <p>Drew created what is my favorite song thus far, so I hope you experience and enjoy the sweet sounds as you watch this story unfold.</p>

                            <p>Here are a few stills from the movie…</p>

Everything about this wedding was amazing and was so much fun to capture. <br/> Both Noah and Rachael had so much unique personality and a subtle joy through the day. When I first met Noah I knew we would be friends..... </p>

                            <p>I can still remember the day we met.</p>
                            <p >I was twenty-two and had just finished my last year in college before starting graduate school.&nbsp; It was a beautiful June day and I was sitting in the park that I used to go to as a kid almost every week.&nbsp; I wasn't in a very good mood because I had just gotten some news that I knew I would be getting.</p>
                            <p>My ex-boyfriend and ex-best friend were getting married.</p>
                            <p>It had been a year since I'd seen either of them, not since I caught them together...in <em>my </em>bed.&nbsp; I was devastated and pulled myself away from everyone.&nbsp; I immersed myself in school and never made time for anyone.&nbsp; I just wanted to be alone.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>I had run into them that morning at the coffee shop that I used to work at in high school.&nbsp; It was awkward, seeing them, even more when we spoke.&nbsp; That was when I caught sight of the glittering diamond ring on her left hand.&nbsp; I couldn't get out of there fast enough before the tears were streaming down my face.&nbsp; I was wanting it to be <em>me </em>wearing his ring on my finger, not <em>her</em>.&nbsp;</p><p data-p-id="cac47cba3580fcf4340605943054d63a">I had run into them that morning at the coffee shop that I used to work at in high school.&nbsp; It was awkward, seeing them, even more when we spoke.&nbsp; That was when I caught sight of the glittering diamond ring on her left hand.&nbsp; I couldn't get out of there fast enough before the tears were streaming down my face.&nbsp; I was wanting it to be <em>me </em>wearing his ring on my finger, not <em>her</em>.&nbsp;</p><p data-p-id="cac47cba3580fcf4340605943054d63a">I had run into them that morning at the coffee shop that I used to work at in high school.&nbsp; It was awkward, seeing them, even more when we spoke.&nbsp; That was when I caught sight of the glittering diamond ring on her left hand.&nbsp; I couldn't get out of there fast enough before the tears were streaming down my face.&nbsp; I was wanting it to be <em>me </em>wearing his ring on my finger, not <em>her</em>.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>It was mostly about Faith as we ate.&nbsp; She wouldn't stop talking, giggling, and smiling.&nbsp; I didn't mind it one bit, though, because I got to see the two of you reacting with each other.&nbsp; While you wiped off her face at the end of our meal, I looked around at the people in the diner.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>With Faith's giggles floating through the air, we were the center of attention.&nbsp; Almost everyone was looking at us with smiles on their own faces.&nbsp; I could even tell what one woman was saying.&nbsp; We were 'such a beautiful family.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>"Our first meet was April 2013, nearly 1,5 year before the wedding day."</p>
                            <p >Quan & Angelique is couple who lives in the moments, loves simple and solid accessories, likes playing with cool and colorful essentials. Gone through movements, they have found love from each other, sharing, respect and say the same voice, even across countries. Living to the fullest, for this very “now” moments is how they treat life, beloves and to each other.</p>
                            <p>All those essences would be, somehow, injected into their wedding day in VietNam (by the way, choosing VietNam is absolutely a risky choice, currently in fact of the weather and political things). A strong emphasis on line and form gives contemporary style and energy wedding. Hue is chosen to be the quiet and peaceful background to support a heavily joyful day: 21 Aug 2014.</p>
                            <p>If there is somewhere in the Earth, you can find a non-stop movement, straight line, abstract shapes mixing with floral design and extending forms, this is “Contemporary” world (reference from houzz.com). Quan & Angelique had the same voice, same page at same line on being crystal clear “what-they-want”. And that helps us a lot on starting planning, then jumping into details. Using navy blue & white as massive layer for the day, on top of that will be Glittery Gold who stands for “forever, long lasting and sparkling love”, Angelique has be minded on what guests can perceived when joining into their day, and, well, as you know, that’s perfect! Nothing is better than you know your wedding guests for well.</p>
                            <p>We have RAIN on that day. People usually assume that “Having rain in a wedding is sign of good luck”. Honestly, not everyone likes it! Feeling of mooding, irritating and humidity is not easy to bare. That led us to a big decision: Moving up the time of ceremony to 2PM, quite early to catch the sunset, but not yet early enough for the rain. Ultimately, it was raining, in the middle of the ceremony. Being highly awared and in the mood of accepting, the stage and off-stage was full, thought water from sky. Umbrellas, sacred steps, smile, hands, hugs, kisses, speech, bless… all’s around for the couple. Who can forget the kiss under the rain?? (even after watching Spiderman ^_^).</p>
                            <p>Time for relaxing and waiting for dinner reception. The gangs got crazy in pool, while the girls got so many other things to do. Quan’s wearing a glittery vest, while Angelique with a first-ever-before-simple wedding dress. Guests liberally suited in diversified styles. 3 hour gap gave chances for everyone to have an entirely new outlook, coincidently, blew a new breeze to next session of the day.</p>
                            <p>Dinner reception is kind of sophisticated neutral, monochromatic and tone-on-tone design with U-shape dinning tables, headly covered with Strings of Light-bulps, lighting up the whole night view. The mix btw Glittery, Stripped white & navy, contemporary furniture items: chandeliers, cool frames, woody stock… Everything, match and making one pieces: contemporary look for the party. In that garden, crazy things happened: “katy-peri dance, lip-sing-show, hiphop show, firework first dance, bridal bouquet tossing and so many more…</p>
                            <p>A night that wouldn’t sleep!</p>
                            <p>Like a modern life!</p>
                            <p>For a modern couple!</p>
